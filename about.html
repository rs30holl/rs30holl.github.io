                    I am currently a Senior at Siena College, majoring in Software Development. I have a passion for
                    solving problems and working on new projects. In the past I have worked on projects using Angular, Java,
                    JavaScript, and basic front end designs. I have some experience in PHP, Python, SQL, and database technologies.
                    I enjoy learning new languages, techniques, or anything else that can help me.
